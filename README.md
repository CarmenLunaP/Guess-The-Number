### Guess The Number

Guess The Number is an interactive game developed in C# that challenges players to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. The game takes place in the terminal, where both the player and the computer take turns trying to guess the number.

#### Project Summary

The project focuses on building a console application in C# that implements the logic of the "Guess The Number" game. The player and the computer take turns trying to guess the secret number, providing feedback after each guess. The game ends when one of the players guesses the secret number.

#### Learning Objectives

The project addresses the following learning objectives:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Concepts of classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces are applied.
- C# Language: Variables, conditionals, loops, operators, and namespaces are used.
- Data Handling: Primitive and non-primitive data types are worked with, and collections like lists and arrays are used.
- Input/Output: The console is used for data input and message output.
- Unit Testing: Unit tests with MSTest are implemented to validate the game's functionality.

#### Project Milestones

1. **Development Environment Setup**: Installation of the .NET SDK, development environment setup, and creation of a console project in C#.
2. **Control Structures and Input/Output**: Implementation of basic control structures and interaction with the console to request and display messages.
3. **Classes and Objects**: Creation of classes to encapsulate the game's functionality and manage interactions between players.
4. **Encapsulation and Class Methods**: Refactoring of the code to protect the internal state of classes and creation of specific methods to handle game functionalities.
5. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Transformation of the main class into an abstract class, and creation of derived classes to represent different types of players.
6. **Unit Testing Implementation**: Development of unit tests with MSTest to validate the logic and functionality of the game.

#### Technical Considerations

- **.NET Version**: The project is based on .NET 5.0 or higher.
- **Project Structure**: The code is organized into separate classes to maintain modularity and code clarity.
- **Documentation and Comments**: The code is well-documented with comments to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
